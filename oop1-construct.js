Bonus Exercises:

//4. Create three more instances of the Shape class for a pentagon, hexagon, and an octagon.

//shapes.  Also, as noted above, if you use the formula to calculate the height of the triangle 
//instead of hard coding it, you will also obtain the bonus for this exercise.  
//The dimensions for the triangle are already provided for you in the triangle object literal.


//5. Below is a class Earth.  It is instantiated with a earth 'instance'.  Because there is only 1 
//known earth, we don't want multiple instances of earth.  Modify the class so the properties are 
//usuable WITHOUT instantiating the class.
