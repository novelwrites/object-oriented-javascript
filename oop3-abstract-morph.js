/*
1. Create a Abstract Creature class that is NOT allowed to be instantiated.
//Find a way to prevent this class from being instantiated with an instance.  
//In the Creature class, include two abstract methods.  move(), and act().  
//These methods are NOT allowed to be invoked from the Abstract class, so 
throw an error in these methods if they are invoked by any inherited sub-classes.  

Create at least 3 sub-classes that inherit from the Abstract Creature Class.  Example sub-classes are: 
    -Human
    -Dinosaur
    -Bird
    -Reptile
    -Fish

These sub-classes MUST implement the abstract methods of move() and act(), which are found on the 
abstract Creature class. In addition to the 2 abstract methods, implement 1 unique method on each sub-class.
Also, each sub-class MUST have at least 2 unique property fields on them.  Example property fields are:
    -name
    -weight
    -food
    -age
